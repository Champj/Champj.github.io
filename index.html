    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
    <p>
      We are a small, passionate <span class="highlight">boutique app development team</span> with a mission to make the world a better place—one app at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our focus is on building digital solutions that contribute positively to society. One of our key projects is a <span class="highlight">health diagnosis app</span> designed to assist people in checking their health and exploring potential treatment options—both traditional and alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're driven by empathy, creativity, and a belief in technology as a force for good. If we can make even a small difference, we've done our job.
